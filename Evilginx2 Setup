export GOPATH=/home/git/go
export GOROOT=/usr/local/src/go

source ~/.bashrc
The following command automatically detects and downloads the latest version of the Go language files:

wget `curl -s https://golang.org/dl/ | grep -E -o 'https://[a-z0-9./]{5,}go[0-9.]{3,}linux-amd64.tar.gz' | head -n 1`
Extract the downloaded archive:
